# AI Agent Best Practices

These practices help autonomous agents extend SmetaPro safely and efficiently.

## Development Workflow

1. **Sync Dependencies** – Run `npm install` and keep lockfiles committed.
2. **Static Analysis** – Lint with `npm run lint` before opening a PR.
3. **Accessibility First** – Verify new components with VoiceOver/NVDA and color-contrast tools.
4. **Localization** – All user-facing copy must be translated to `en` and `ru`.
5. **Testing** – Update or add Playwright scenarios for any UX change.
6. **Performance** – Target Lighthouse scores ≥90 for Performance and Accessibility.

## Coding Guidelines

- Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled.
- Avoid inline styles where Tailwind utilities suffice.
- Prefer composable components; keep pages declarative.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` and `prefers-contrast` media queries.
- Keep gestures keyboard-accessible (provide alternative buttons).

## Git & PRs

- One feature per branch. Use conventional commit messages when possible.
- Keep PR descriptions aligned with the template generated by the `make_pr` tool.
- Include screenshots for UI changes (use browser container tooling).

## Security

- Never hardcode production secrets. Use environment variables.
- Validate clipboard or file APIs with user consent messaging.
- When integrating backend APIs, ensure HTTPS endpoints and JWT/OAuth best practices.

## Collaboration

- Document design decisions in `/docs` with timestamps and authorship.
- Share test evidence (Playwright traces, Lighthouse reports) in PR attachments.
- Maintain parity between English and Russian documentation where applicable.
