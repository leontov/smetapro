# smetapro

This repository has been reset to a fresh starting point. It now contains a minimal JavaScript module that exports a `greet` function and a simple smoke test to demonstrate the setup.

## Getting started

1. Install Node.js 18 or newer.
2. (Optional) Install dependencies — this project currently has no external packages, so `npm install` is not required.
3. Run the example script:

   ```bash
   npm start -- Alice
   ```

4. Execute the basic test harness:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

Feel free to build upon this scaffold to create the next iteration of the project.
